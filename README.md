📘 Project Title: Bookstore Management System (Python)
🧩 Project Description

The Bookstore Management System is a simple Python-based project designed to help manage book records efficiently.
It allows users to add, view, search, and delete books using a clean, menu-driven console interface.
This system is created using basic Python concepts such as lists, dictionaries, and functions, making it perfect for beginners who are learning how to organize and handle real-world data in Python.

🧠 Objective

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how Python can be used to create a simple yet functional management system for small businesses like bookstores.
It helps in understanding how to:

Store data using lists and dictionaries

Use functions for modular programming

Perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations

Work with loops, conditions, and user inputs effectively

⚙️ Features

Add Book – Add a new book with its title, author, and price.

View All Books – Display all books in the store in a neat list.

Search Book – Find books by title or author name.

Delete Book – Remove a specific book by its number.

Exit – Quit the program safely.

🧮 Technologies Used

Language: Python

Concepts: Functions, Lists, Dictionaries, Loops, Conditionals, User Input

💡 Learning Outcomes

By creating this project, you’ll learn:

How to break a big problem into smaller functions

How to manage data using Python collections

How to build an interactive menu-based application

How to think logically like a programmer

🧾 Conclusion

This Bookstore Management System is a great mini project for beginners to strengthen their Python fundamentals.
It can be further improved by adding file handling (to save data permanently) or object-oriented programming (OOP) to make it more scalable.
